<p style = "color:#710193;font-size:28"><b><u>Types of Diabetes</u></b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:20">
There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant).
</p>
<p style = "color:#000000;font-size:20"><b>1) Type 1 Diabetes</b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:18">Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake) that stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It’s usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.
</p>
<p style = "color:#000000;font-size:20"><b>2) Type 2 Diabetes</b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:18">With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). You may not notice any symptoms, so it’s important to get your blood sugar tested if you’re at risk. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active.
</p>
<p style = "color:#000000;font-size:20"><b>3) Gestational Diabetes</b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:20">Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born but increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a child or teen, and more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life too.</p>

<p style = "color:#710193;font-size:28"><b><u>Symptons of Diabetes</u></b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:20">The general symptoms of diabetes include:</p>
<ul style = "color:#565656;font-size:20">
<li>increased hunger</li>
<li>increased thirst</li>
<li>weight loss</li>
<li>frequent urination</li>
<li>blurry vision</li>
<li>extreme fatigue</li>
<li>sores that don’t heal</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style = "color:#710193;font-size:28"><b>Symptoms in men</b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:20">In addition to the general symptoms of diabetes, men with diabetes may have a decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction (ED), and poor muscle strength.</p>
<p style = "color:#710193;font-size:28"><b>Symptons in women</b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:20">Women with diabetes can also have symptoms such as urinary tract infections, yeast infections, and dry, itchy skin.</p>
<hr>
<p style = "color:#710193;font-size:28"><b><u>Causes of diabetes</u></b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:20">Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.</p>
<p style = "color:#000000;font-size:20"><b>1) Type 1 Diabetes</b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:20">Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off the immune system attack.</p>
<p style = "color:#000000;font-size:20"><b>2) Type 2 Diabetes</b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:20">Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Being overweight or obese increases your risk too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar. This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.</p>
<p style = "color:#000000;font-size:20"><b>3) Gestational Diabetes</b></p>
<p style = "color:#565656;font-size:20">Gestational diabetes is the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant woman’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.
Women who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during their pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes.</p>
